# Notepad-Android-App
An Android app to take and manage text-based notes

The features are intuitive, except for one where you have to click a note and hold so that a menu of what to do with the note pops up.

I have not published this app to the Google Play Store. You can download the apk file here (https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=19GSbEMk_Sg_-DoHgdAnbNXn4XIZz8lk5)
